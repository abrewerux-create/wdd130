        <p>Hello! My name is Allison Brewer, and I am a student in the BYU Pathways program.</p>
        <p>By day, I work as a UX Researcher and Designer, which has made me especially interested
            in how web development and user experience work together. Because I work in design, I
            pay close attention to how websites are organized and how
            easy they are for users to navigate. </p>
        <p>I’m also a wife and a mother of six children, so life is always busy and full of energy
            in our home! I enjoy creative projects and love learning new skills that I can apply in
            both my
            professional work and personal life. An interesting fact about me is that I have a
            sphinx cat named Scarlett No’Hara.</p>
        <p>I’m taking WDD130 to strengthen my skills and learn how to build websites that are clear,
            functional, and enjoyable to use.</p>
        <!-- <p>In this course, I’m excited to learn more about HTML and CSS and how to build a strong
            foundation in web development. I’m especially interested in creating clean layouts,
            improving accessibility, and
            designing content that is easy to scan and understand. I’m looking forward to growing
            throughout this course, building projects I can be proud
            of, and applying what I learn to future opportunities!</p> -->

        <p>Arizona is a wonderful state! Most people think of desert when they think of Arizona, but
            the state actually has a wide variety of landscapes including forests, lakes, snowy
            mountains, and rivers.</p>
