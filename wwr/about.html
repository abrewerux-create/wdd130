                <p>Our motto isn’t just a catchy phrase—it’s how we run every trip. We believe the
                    best river
                    adventures feel equal parts <strong>safe, welcoming, and unforgettable,</strong>
                    no matter your
                    age or experience
                    level. From the first paddle stroke to the final high-five, our guides are there
                    to encourage you,
                    keep things smooth, and make sure you’re having the time of your life. Because
                    at the end of the
                    day, the goal is simple: <strong>leave the river happier than you came</strong>

        <!-- History Section -->
        <section>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The Happy Paddle Raft Co. started with one raft, one beat-up truck, and a simple
                idea: river days
                should feel like the best day of summer.</p>

            <p>Back in 2014, two best friends (and lifelong outdoors lovers) began taking
                friends
                and family down
                their favorite stretch of river every weekend. Word spread fast—because the
                trips
                weren’t just about
                the rapids… they were about the laughter, the music, the snacks, the goofy group
                photos, and the
                guides who made everyone feel confident and safe.</p>

            <p>By 2017, those weekend float trips turned into a real business, built on a
                reputation for friendly
                guides, family-first fun, and the kind of river memories people talk about for
                years.</p>

            <p>Today, The Happy Paddle Raft Co. is proud to be a local favorite—still led by the
                same mission that
                started it all:
                make every guest feel like part of the crew, and every trip feel like pure joy.
