        <p>Hello! My name is Allison Brewer, and I am a student in the BYU Pathways program.</p>
        <p>By day, I work as a UX Researcher and Designer, which has made me especially interested
            in how web development and user experience work together. Because I work in design, I
            pay close attention to how websites are organized and how
            easy they are for users to navigate. </p>
        <p>I’m also a wife and a mother of six children, so life is always busy and full of energy
            in our home! I enjoy creative projects and love learning new skills that I can apply in
            both my
            professional work and personal life. An interesting fact about me is that I have a
            sphinx cat named Scarlett No’Hara.</p>
        <p>I’m taking WDD130 to strengthen my skills and learn how to build websites that are clear,
            functional, and enjoyable to use.</p>

        <p>Arizona is a wonderful state! Most people think of desert when they think of Arizona, but
            the state actually has a wide variety of landscapes including forests, lakes, snowy
            mountains, and rivers.</p>
