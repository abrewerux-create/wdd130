        <p>Hello! I am a student in the BYU Pathways program. I am a UX Researcher & Designer by
            day. I am also a wife and a mother (to 6 children). An interesting fact about me is that
            I have a sphinx cat named Scarlett No'Hara.</p>

        <p>Arizona is a wonderful state! Most people think of desert when they think of Arizona, but
            the state actually has a wide variety of landscapes including forests, lakes, snowy
            mountains, and rivers.</p>
